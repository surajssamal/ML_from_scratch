# Ml-Model-from-scratch

these are some models which ive created from vanilla scratch using only numpy 

## Lessons Learned

models like

1. linear regression
2. sigmoid regression
3. pca(principal component anaylisis)
4. random forest
5. decision tree
6. perceptron aka 1 neuron of nn and Gradient Decent

## Installation

first git clone the project 

```bash
  git clone {Repository-name}
```
    
## Deployment

To run each file you'll have to run each file individually 
```bash

  or 
  jupyter-notebook {file-name}
```
